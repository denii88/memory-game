# User Eperience
It is divided on three smaller sections,one for the first time users, one for the regular users and one for the owner.

### First-time users 

1. As a first-time user,I want to understand what the game goal is.
2. As a first-time user,I want to know the game rules.
3. As a first time user,I want to challenge my memory.
4. As a first-time user,I want to be able to navigate the page without long waiting time.
5. As a firt-time user,I want to see how long does it take me to complete the game.

### Regular visitor

6. As a regular user,I want to see my score.
7. As a regular user,I want to see how many moves I made.

### Site owner

8. As a site owner, I want users to be able navigate easy through the page and its features.
9. As a site owner,I want users to have fun and come back again.

## Features left to implement 

* I would like to make bigger game for the desktop,I have tried putting 20 cards on the table,but it was just too big and messy,especially for the mobile users as the icons were too small and it was too many of them.
